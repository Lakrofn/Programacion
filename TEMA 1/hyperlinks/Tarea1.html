    Introduction to HTML: HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. It forms the foundation of the World Wide Web, allowing browsers to interpret and display the content of web pages. HTML uses a set of tags and elements to define the structure, format, and presentation of the information contained within a webpage.
        
    HTML is a markup language because it uses tags to mark up different elements and provide instructions to the web browser about how those elements should be displayed. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags is affected by the instructions provided by the tags.
        
    Web developers use HTML to create the basic structure of a webpage by defining headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, images, and links. HTML also allows the inclusion of multimedia elements, such as audio and video, and provides support for embedding other web technologies, like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
        
    HTML documents are typically saved with a .html or .htm extension and can be created using a simple text editor. Once an HTML document is created, it can be viewed in a web browser, which interprets the HTML code and renders the webpage according to the specified structure and formatting.
        
    In summary, HTML is the language that enables the creation of web pages by defining their structure and content. It plays a crucial role in the development of websites and the presentation of information on the internet.</pre>
    <h2 id="2">A Simple HTML Document</h2>
        <a href="#1">What is HTML?</a>
            <pre>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                 &lt;html&gt;
                 &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
                 &lt;/head&gt;
                 &lt;body&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                 &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;

    Explanation for the above example
                    
            The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
            The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page
            The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page
            The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser’s title bar or in the page’s tab)
            The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document’s body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading
                    
    In the above example, the elements which are enclosed by the angle brackets are known as <b>HTML tags</b>. They have two tags: one is the opening tag and the other one is the closing tag.
    The <b>opening tag</b> starts with the “&lt;” character, followed by the tag name, and ends with the “&gt;” character. For example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag for a paragraph element.
    The <b>closing tag</b> starts with “&lt;/” character. For example, &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag for the paragraph element.
